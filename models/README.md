# Models folder
The models folder contains the neural networks architectures used in my thesis at DTU in Spring 2023. The [base_model.py](https://github.com/jesperhauch/polynomial_deep_learning/blob/master/models/base_model.py) file contains the base classes used for the models. There it is specified which metrics are being logged and how the steps for training, validation and testing are conducted. The [neural_nets.py](https://github.com/jesperhauch/polynomial_deep_learning/blob/master/models/neural_nets.py) implements simple neural networks including a feed forward neural network (FFNN) and a polynomial activation neural network (PANN). The [pi_nets.py](https://github.com/jesperhauch/polynomial_deep_learning/blob/master/models/pi_nets.py) file contains polynomial neural networks from the [$\Pi$-Nets paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13026) and from [Augmenting Deep Classifiers with Polynomial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07916.pdf). In the papers, these architectures were implemented as computer vision networks, while they are implemented for regression in this repository.
